## 🗓️ **2-Day Execution Timeline**

### **Day 1: Setup & Training Start** 📅

#### **Morning (4 hours): Dataset Preparation**
```bash
# 9:00 AM - Split dataset
python split_dataset.py --source housebrain_dataset_v5_500k_colab --output housebrain_splits

# 10:00 AM - Create zip files for upload
cd housebrain_splits
for i in {01..06}; do
    zip -r split_${i}.zip split_${i}/
done
```

### Additional training notes

- Masked SFT collator is enabled (training focuses on assistant JSON only)
- Optional sequence packing can be toggled to improve utilization on T4
- Eval split is used when present; pick best run by eval loss and JSON validity rate
- Ensure identical LoRA configs across runs to safely merge adapters

#### **Afternoon (4 hours): Platform Setup**
```bash
# 1:00 PM - Upload to all 6 accounts simultaneously
# Use Safari tabs to monitor all accounts

# Colab 1: Upload split_01.zip → Start training
# Colab 2: Upload split_02.zip → Start training  
# Colab 3: Upload split_03.zip → Start training
# Kaggle 1: Upload split_04.zip → Start training
# Kaggle 2: Upload split_05.zip → Start training
# Kaggle 3: Upload split_06.zip → Start training
```

### **Day 2: Training Completion & Merging** 📅

#### **Morning (4 hours): Monitor & Download**
```bash
# 9:00 AM - Check all 6 accounts
# Download completed models as they finish

# Expected completion times:
# - Fast accounts: 8-10 hours (overnight)
# - Slower accounts: 10-12 hours (morning)
```

#### **Afternoon (4 hours): Model Merging**
```bash
# 1:00 PM - Merge all models
python merge_models.py \
    --models models/housebrain-colab-1 models/housebrain-colab-2 models/housebrain-colab-3 \
              models/housebrain-kaggle-1 models/housebrain-kaggle-2 models/housebrain-kaggle-3 \
    --output models/housebrain-production \
    --strategy average \
    --validate

# 3:00 PM - Start 2D/3D implementation
# 5:00 PM - Production model ready!
```

## 💾 **Frequent Checkpointing Strategy**

### **Save Every 100 Steps** 🔄
```python
# Training configuration with frequent saves
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="models/housebrain-colab-1",
    save_steps=100,  # Save every 100 steps
    save_total_limit=10,  # Keep last 10 checkpoints
    logging_steps=10,
    # ... other args
)
```

### **Checkpoint Recovery** 🔄
```python
# If training crashes, resume from latest checkpoint
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=dataset,
    data_collator=data_collator
)

# Resume training automatically
trainer.train(resume_from_checkpoint=True)
```

### **Model Download Strategy** 📥
```bash
# Download checkpoints every 2 hours
# Keep local backup of all models
# Monitor training progress via logs
```

---

## 🔀 **Model Merging Strategy**

### **3 Merge Strategies Available**

#### **1. Average Merging** 📊
```python
# Average LoRA weights from all 6 models
python merge_models.py --strategy average
```
**Best for**: Balanced performance across all models

#### **2. Weighted Merging** ⚖️
```python
# Weight models based on training quality
python merge_models.py --strategy weighted
```
**Best for**: Giving preference to better-trained models

#### **3. Best Model Selection** 🏆
```python
# Select the best performing model
python merge_models.py --strategy best
```
**Best for**: When one model clearly outperforms others

### **Recommended: Average Merging**
- ✅ **Balanced performance**
- ✅ **Robust to individual model issues**
- ✅ **Best overall quality**

---

## 📱 **Monitoring Strategy**

### **Safari Multi-Tab Monitoring** 🖥️
```bash
# Open 6 tabs in Safari:
# Tab 1: Colab Account 1 (split_01)
# Tab 2: Colab Account 2 (split_02)  
# Tab 3: Colab Account 3 (split_03)
# Tab 4: Kaggle Account 1 (split_04)
# Tab 5: Kaggle Account 2 (split_05)
# Tab 6: Kaggle Account 3 (split_06)
```

### **Progress Tracking** 📈
```python
# Monitor these metrics:
- Training loss (should decrease)
- GPU usage (should be stable)
- Memory usage (should be stable)
- Steps completed / total steps
- Estimated time remaining
```
