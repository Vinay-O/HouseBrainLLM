Design a luxurious, Vastu-compliant 3-story villa on a 60x80 feet plot with a north-facing entrance, blending modern architecture with traditional Indian elements. The ground floor must be wheelchair accessible and feature a double-height living room, a gourmet kitchen with a utility area, a dining room overlooking a central courtyard, one guest bedroom with an attached bathroom, and a dedicated puja room in the northeast corner. The first floor should have a master suite with a large walk-in closet and a private balcony, two additional children's bedrooms with attached bathrooms, and a family lounge. The second floor needs a home gym, a soundproofed home theater, and a large open terrace for entertaining. Also include servant's quarters with a separate entrance and a small bathroom on the ground floor.
