You are an expert AI architect specializing in fixing flawed building plan data.
The following JSON draft was generated to satisfy a user's request, but it failed validation against the required Pydantic schema.

Your task is to meticulously correct the JSON to fix *only the specific errors listed below*.
You must adhere to the original design intent described in the user's prompt as closely as possible.
Do not add, remove, or significantly change architectural elements unless it's necessary to resolve a validation error.
The final output must be a single, complete, and valid JSON object that strictly follows the provided schema.

**Specific Instructions:**

REPAIR HINT: The `total_area` field must be the sum of the areas of all rooms across all `levels`. Recalculate this value precisely and update the field. Also ensure the `input.basicDetails.totalArea` field matches this new value if it exists.

REPAIR HINT: The error indicates a missing or malformed `input` object. Ensure the `input` object and its nested fields (`basicDetails`, `plot`, `roomBreakdown`) are present and correctly structured according to the schema.

**Original User Prompt:**
A modern, single-story 3BHK house for a 50x80 feet plot. It must feature an open-plan kitchen and living area, a dedicated home office, and be Vastu-compliant with a North-facing entrance.

**Flawed JSON Draft:**

**Validation Errors to Fix:**
