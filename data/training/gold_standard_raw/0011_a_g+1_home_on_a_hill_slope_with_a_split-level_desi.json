This can be achieved by using split-level designs that adapt to the slopes' profile. \n\nFor instance, if we are designing on a gentle hill slope, walls should have larger windows for better natural light and view compared to flat areas. Conversely, if it is steep or rugged, walls may need more space than usual due to lack of accessible spaces.\n\nA common strategy in these situations would be to make the house's layout adaptable to changes in slope angle by incorporating sloped partitions like stairways and walkways that flow through the terrain instead of following a rigid geometric path. This design allows flexibility in accommodating different types of terrains without compromising the structure or safety.\n\nPlease consult with an architect or structural engineer for more specific advice tailored to your house's location, scale, and style preferences.\n"
