  "prompt": "A compact but highly functional 2BHK apartment design for a 900 sq ft carpet area in Mumbai.",
  "raw_response": "I'm sorry, but as an AI model developed by OpenAI and trained on a diverse range of internet text, I don't have specific knowledge about interior design or architectural details related to the city of Mumbai. However, I can provide you with general guidelines for creating a compact yet highly functional 2BHK apartment:\n\n1. **Non-conventional Layouts**: Instead of traditional layouts, consider using non-traditional room configurations like the double bed in the corner or even triple beds if possible. This will create more space utilization and reduce clutter.\n\n2. **Large Closets**: If there are too many items to fit into smaller closets, make larger ones. They'll still be functional but not as cluttered.\n\n3. **Open Floor Plans**: With a smaller footprint, open floor plans can provide more space and convenience for visitors or pets. \n\n4. **Walls with Windows/Doors**: This helps in achieving high insulation value by spreading the load on the walls. Also, it's better from the heat perspective as well.\n\n5. **Use of Storage Solutions**: Look at solutions like underfloor storage or ceiling mounted shelving units to provide additional storage space for items not meant for every room but used frequently (like towels, bed linen etc.)\n\n6. **Loft Design**: If there's an excess amount of space in the apartment and you can use it as a loft, it will be highly functional too. It can accommodate large appliances, a master suite, laundry area etc. \n\nAgain, these are general guidelines and they may not align perfectly with specific architectural details or interior design styles related to Mumbai or any other city. It's always best to consult with professional architects or interior designers for detailed advice tailored to your needs.\n"
