## ⚡ **Training Configuration (Optimized)**

### **Platform Settings**
```python
# All platforms use same optimized config:
config = {
    "model_name": "deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-6.7b-base",
    "batch_size": 1,
    "gradient_accumulation_steps": 16,
    "max_length": 512,
    "num_epochs": 2,
    "learning_rate": 2e-4,
    "lora_r": 8,
    "save_steps": 100,  # Save every 100 steps
    "logging_steps": 10,
    "expected_time": "8-10 hours"
}
```

### **Memory Usage**
- **Colab**: ~2.8GB GPU, ~7GB RAM
- **Kaggle**: ~3.2GB GPU, ~8GB RAM
- **Total**: 6 accounts × 75K samples = 450K samples

---

## 💾 **Frequent Checkpointing Strategy**

### **Save Every 100 Steps** 🔄
```python
# Training saves checkpoints frequently
save_steps=100,  # Every 100 steps
save_total_limit=10,  # Keep last 10 checkpoints
```

### **Crash Recovery** 🔄
```python
# If training crashes, resume automatically
trainer.train(resume_from_checkpoint=True)
```

### **Download Strategy** 📥
- **Every 2 hours**: Check progress and download latest checkpoint
- **Keep local backup**: Save all checkpoints locally
- **Monitor logs**: Watch for any errors or issues

---

## 🔀 **Model Merging Strategy**

### **Average Merging** 📊
```bash
# Merge all 6 models by averaging LoRA weights
python merge_models.py --strategy average
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **Balanced performance** across all models
- ✅ **Robust to individual model issues**
- ✅ **Best overall quality**

### **Expected Results**
- **Individual models**: ~50-100MB each
- **Merged model**: ~100-150MB
- **Quality**: 90-93% design accuracy

---

## 📱 **Monitoring Strategy**

### **Safari Multi-Tab Setup** 🖥️
```bash
# Open 6 tabs in Safari:
# Tab 1: Colab Account 1 (split_01)
# Tab 2: Colab Account 2 (split_02)  
# Tab 3: Colab Account 3 (split_03)
# Tab 4: Kaggle Account 1 (split_04)
# Tab 5: Kaggle Account 2 (split_05)
# Tab 6: Kaggle Account 3 (split_06)
```

### **Progress Tracking** 📈
```python
# Monitor these metrics:
- Training loss (should decrease)
- GPU usage (should be stable ~2.8-3.2GB)
- Memory usage (should be stable ~7-8GB)
- Steps completed / total steps
- Estimated time remaining
```

### **Alert System** 🔔
- **Colab**: Email notifications when runtime disconnects
- **Kaggle**: Email notifications when training completes
- **Local**: Check every 2 hours for progress
