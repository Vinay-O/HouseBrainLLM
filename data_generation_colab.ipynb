        "**Workflow:**\n",
        "1.  **Setup:** Mounts Google Drive, clones the repository using a secure token prompt, and installs dependencies.\n",
        "2.  **Ollama Server:** Installs and runs the Ollama server in the background.\n",
        "3.  **Model Provisioning:** Pulls two models: a fast model for initial generation (`llama3:8b`) and a powerful model for repairs (`qwen3:30b`).\n",
        "4.  **Prompt Loading:** Creates a `prompts.txt` file to serve as the workload for the factory.\n",
        "5.  **Automated Curation:** For each prompt, it runs an orchestration script which:\n",
        "    a.  **Generates** a draft using the fast `llama3:8b`.\n",
        "    b.  **Analyzes** the draft for errors.\n",
        "    c.  **Repairs** the draft using the powerful `qwen3:30b` if needed.\n",
        "6.  **Output:** Saves the final, validated \"Gold Standard\" JSON files directly to your Google Drive.\n"
