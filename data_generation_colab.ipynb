        "This notebook is a dedicated environment for generating a large, high-quality dataset of architectural plans. It uses a single, powerful model (`qwen3:30b`) for the entire `Generate -> Analyze -> Repair` pipeline.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Workflow:**\n",
        "1.  **Setup:** Mounts Google Drive, clones the repository using a secure token prompt, and installs dependencies.\n",
        "2.  **Ollama Server:** Installs and runs the Ollama server in the background.\n",
        "3.  **Model Provisioning:** Pulls the powerful `qwen3:30b` model.\n",
        "4.  **Prompt Loading:** Creates a `prompts.txt` file to serve as the workload for the factory.\n",
        "5.  **Automated Curation:** For each prompt, it runs an orchestration script which uses `qwen3:30b` to generate a draft, analyze it, and repair it if necessary.\n",
        "6.  **Output:** Saves the final, validated \"Gold Standard\" JSON files directly to your Google Drive. This dataset can then be used to fine-tune any other model, such as Llama 3.\n"
